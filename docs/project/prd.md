# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Email Classification MVP

## 1. Product Overview
The project involves creating a system that allows sending an email in EML format along with attachments, extracting metadata, and automatically classifying attachments based on a predefined list of categories. The system is designed with law firms in mind, enabling quick search and organization of documents. Additional functionalities include filtering and sorting results, GDPR compliance through encryption in transit and at rest.

## 2. User Problem
A law firm has an enormous number of historical emails containing attachments (e.g., contracts, documents, letter templates). Manually searching and classifying these documents is time-consuming and inefficient. The system aims to automate the classification of attachments, allowing for rapid retrieval of needed documents and improving overall efficiency.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. User Authentication
   - Users must be able to securely log in to the system using an authentication mechanism that encrypts data in transit.
2. Email Submission
   - The system allows the submission of a single email in EML format along with its attachments.
3. Metadata Extraction
   - Automatically extract metadata such as sender, recipient, date, subject, and the list of attachments.
4. Attachment Classification
   - Automatically classify each attachment (accepted formats: pdf, docs, tiff, jpg) based on a predefined list of categories.
5. Data Storage
   - Store the email and its corresponding attachments along with classification results.
6. Viewing Results
   - Allow users to view a list of emails and their associated attachments with classification outcomes.
7. Filtering and Sorting
   - Provide options to filter and sort the results by sender, attachment type, and attachment name.
8. Attachment Download
   - Enable users to download individual attachments.

## 4. Product Boundaries
1. The system does not include comprehensive user account management (e.g., password reset, profile editing).
2. Only emails in the EML format are supported; other import formats are not included.
3. The classification focuses solely on attachments, not on the full content of the email.
4. The initial performance assumption is processing 1 attachment per second; the system is not optimized for mass parallel processing.
5. The application does not support a mobile version.
